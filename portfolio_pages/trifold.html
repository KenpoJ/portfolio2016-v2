        <h4>Trifold Brochure Design<br>
            <small>School</small>
        </h4>
        <p>The project was to create a trifold brochure, front and back, that described sustainability. Copy was created from online sources and the illustrations were an attempt by me at something a little different. Illustrated elements created in Illustrator and laid out in InDesign.</p>
